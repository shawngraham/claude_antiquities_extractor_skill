## Usage Notes

1. **When to consult**: Reference a known figure's profile to enrich attributes and verify dates/roles
2. **Cross-referencing**: If extracting a document mentions "Medici," cross-check against this reference to add confirmed attributes (nationality: Italian, role: dealer, etc.)
3. **Ambiguity resolution**: If "Camera" is mentioned without context, consult here to determine if it's Pasquale Camera (smuggler) vs. another figure
4. **Relationship enrichment**: If extracting "sold to Getty Museum," you can add institutional context from the Getty profile
5. **Historical accuracy**: These profiles are based on documented sources; use as baseline but update if new information appears in extracted document

## How to Add New Entries

If extraction reveals a significant figure not in this reference:
1. Include all known details (nationality, dates, role)
2. Note sources (publication, court record, etc.)
3. Flag for research to verify documentation
4. Add to future reference updates
